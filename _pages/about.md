Consultant, full stack developer, devops engineer and speaker with 20+ years of experience in the IT business. I hold a degree in computer science and work as a freelancer.
I am passionate about agile development, automation, open source and security, [twelve factor methodology](https://12factor.net/)

I am interested in minimalist lifestyle, photography, cooking, music, guitar playing. I like to travel, cycle, run, hike and climb.

What I consider important: My family, sustainabilty, energy revolution.
Things that annoy me: Unreliability, bad time- and self-management, SUVs.
