Hi there @Kona,

my name is Christian and I'm a cyclist from Germany.

This is my application for the Kona Ambassador program :-)

## Where do you live and what kind of bikes do you ride?

Born and raised in northern Germany I’ve been an avid runner and cyclist from early on. Tired of the bad weather and traffic in Hamburg I moved to a small village near Freiburg in southern Germany 17 years ago. Since then, I've been cycling and exploring the Black Forest, Kaiserstuhl and Alsace region.

I was a total roadie in the first half of my cycling life. I’ve been doing multi-day cycling tours in Europe (mostly FR, IT, CH, ES, DE) with friends for almost 20 years. Currently I ride a Scott Solace 10 carbon road bike.

Two years ago I discovered adventure bikepacking and gravel riding. And I absolutely love it!
I bought a Kona Rove LTD (in beautiful aqua blue!) fitted with 650B wheels and already did some great multi-day tours with it: Torino-Nice-Rally (FR, IT), Bike Crossing Black Forest (DE), Exmoor-Dartmoor-Quantock Hills (UK), Rheintal (DE). I dream of bikepacking Scotland, the Iron Curtain Trail, TransGermany, TransPyrenees and the Tuscany Trail.

When not on the bike, I work as a freelance software engineer, practice my cooking, woodworking and guitar skills and try to raise my two teenage girls. 

What I consider important: My family, sustainabilty, energy revolution. Things that annoy me: Unreliability, bad time- and self-management, SUVs.

## What makes you unique in the biking world?

I am the perfect combination of a software engineer and a cyclist :-)

## What is it about Kona that you love and want to share with others?

Kona bikes have style and character. Not everybody owns a Kona.
I like Konas dedication to steel. My Kona Rove is a reliable and loyal partner on my adventures.
I don't like that todays bikes look all the same boring black. I love the fantastic color schemes of Kona bikes.

## What kind of content are you able to create on your own? Any samples we can see?

As a software developer I'm fluent in programming languages and internet technologies. I also believe I'm a decent photographer and a good writer. 

Please see some examples on my [AirBnb experience "Black forest road bike adventures"](https://www.airbnb.de/experiences/308994) page.

## As a member of the Kona Ambassadors, what kind of support would you like from Kona?

Any kind of equipment support would be awesome, from spare parts and tools to bags and clothing. 
    
## Who is a cyclist you admire most, and why?

Fiona Kolbinger, because she won the TCR and logs incredible rides on Strava. At the same time she is working as a doctor in Dresden. 

Jens Voigt, because he was my hero when I started watching the TdF. He always rode with heart and guts. He is likable, charismatic, straightforward, down-to-earth and funny.

## What is your dream Kona bike setup?

Steel frame, gravel/endurance geometry, two light wheel sets (28" and 650B), drop bar, SRAM AXS shifting, disc brakes.
