title: REWORK really changed the way I work

I am a REWORKer. I love the books REWORK and "Getting Real" by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier-Hansson.
REWORK was the most influential and most important business book for me in the last couple of years.
And it really did "change the way I work forever".

I made REWORK a kind of manifesto for me and I am trying to put all projects under the "REWORK perspective" or under the "REWORK test". Does it align with REWORK principles? What would a REWORKer do?

Both books are refreshing and brilliant. It's hard to pick some quotes as there are so many. Here are some:

> Less is a good thing. Limited Ressources force you to make do with what you've got. Keep features to a minimum. Don't create bloated products. Less features, less options/preferences, less promises.

> Good enough is fine. Find a judo solution, one that delivers maximum efficiency with minimum effort. When good enough gets the job done, go for it. And remember, you can usually turn good enough into great later.

> The best software takes sides. When someone uses software, they’re not just looking for features, they’re looking for an approach. They’re looking for a vision. Decide what your vision is and run with it.

> Don't make things worse by overanalyzing and delaying before you even get going. The longer it takes to develop, the less likely it is to launch.

> Don't be afraid to show your flaws. Show the world what you're really like. Talk like you really talk. Be upfront with your shortcomings. Show the latest version of what you are working on, even if you are not done yet.

> There is nothing wrong with sounding your own size. Being honest about who you are is smart business, too. Avoid jargon or any sort of corporate speak. Write to be read. Forget rules. Communicate!

> It is not worth paying much attention to the competition. Focus on yourself instead.

## Dec 2015 Update: The Minimalists

I recently found
[The Minimalists](http://www.theminimalists.com/). I love their podcasts (I hear them mostly when I'm running :-) and I think REWORK principles and a minimalist lifestyle perfectly fit together. I have been trying to apply some minimalist methods to my work and family life.

I would recommend the useful [Sentimental](http://www.theminimalists.com/011/) postcast episode for getting to know them.
